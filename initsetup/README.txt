Files for configuring for RPI - for building energy project
10/2017
	
###Bash Script File 	
1. Bash script file works fine after boot but it could not be implemmented with Pibakery because it needs to receive information from terminal
	
	
###Using Pibakery
2. initsetup folder - which containt essential files for using PiBakery to initial setup for RPI 
	
	Including:
	
	- Setting wifi - This part I've been used the original code of PiBakery for wifi setting  
	
	- Creating buildingenergy user - passwd: password 
	
	- Generating SSH key
	
	- Copying SSH public keys of team's member to RPI to connect SSH passwordless
	
	
###Note: 
	
If you would like to import a folder to PiBakery, you can drap and drop. 
	
	If drap and drop is not working, you should (Ctrl Shift +) to add that folder (It's a fault of PiBakery)
