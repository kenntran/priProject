### C_Data_Structe
* Knowledge gained from C_course to learn about the Data Structure in C. 
	- Learning how to implement different data structures in C and use them to solve problems with simpler algorthims.
	- Some exercises from course - Import/Export storage + Accounting system. 

### Building Energy Project
* initsetup
 	- Early version for setup RPI environment(adding SSH pub_key, configuring wifi connection, creating buildingenergy account on RPI...) 

* addGitrepo

### Cooling-system project (FAN project) - using Arduino and Interrupt function

### Testing assigment - small program used for learning unit test at school

### Microcontroller programming
* Using Arduino and Arduino IDE to develop those projects
	- Simulating Washing Machine. 
	- Simulating Black Jack game.
	- Simulating Receving-Transmitting Morse code
